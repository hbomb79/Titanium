#### About
Titanium is a feature-rich, reliable framework for creating GUIs within ComputerCraft. Titanium offers a quick and easy experience for those that just want to jump in, however more powerful tools are on standby if you need them.

#### Alpha
Titanium is currently in alpha and your feedback, bug reports, suggestions (via [issues](https://gitlab.com/hbomb79/Titanium/issues)) and [merge requests](https://gitlab.com/hbomb79/Titanium/merge_requests) are welcomed.

#### Documentation
[Documentation](https://gitlab.com/hbomb79/Titanium/wikis/home) is in the works, however the simultaneous development of features takes up a large majority of my free time. Due to this, the documentation is a little lackluster and will be the target of improvements - especially once this project moves into beta.

#### Download and Installation
Please see the [documentation](https://gitlab.com/hbomb79/Titanium/wikis/home) for more information regarding downloading and installing Titanium.
